## Definitions
Client - Person paying for someone else to attend meetings
Rep - An independant representative who'll represent the client on a once off basis
Quote - Amount quoted by Rep to a Client
Entity - The person or organisation being represented in the meeting

## How It Works
Clients fill a form on the platform that describes the meeting they need help with.
Once submitted, the platform emails the related info to reps who work that particular area where the meeting will be held.
Reps give quotes by opening the job card link and fill in how much they'd charge to attend the meeting.
Once a rep is done filling the quote, it's emailed back to the client.
Client accepts a specific quote by clicking on its link & pays through payfast
The winning rep is than notified of the payment and they are given the full details of the job.
The winning rep needs to confirm that they'll take the job.
If a Rep doesn't confirm in 12 hours, the job is cancelled for the Rep and the Client needs to pick a new rep for the job. If the the new rep's price is higher, the client will have to add funds. If lower, the change will be left as a balance on the platform.
Rep goes to the meeting & does the required activity and gets proof of it.
Rep must confirm that they're at the right location by uploading their location on platform
Rep uploads the required details and or docs to the platform after meeting is finished gives feedback to client.
The system will then notifify the client that the work has been done. They now need to approve it.
If the Client disputes the work, then the platform's dispute resolution process will be handled manually.
If a client doesn't respond in 2 days, the funds are automatically released.
Rep is paid, with system taking a 20% cut
Once the funds are released, the client is asked to rate the rep
The rep is also asked to rate the client.
